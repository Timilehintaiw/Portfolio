# Timilehin Taiwo's Testing portfolio
Hi, Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate software tester specializing in manual and automation testing. This repository showcases my skills, projects, and accomplishments in the field of software testing.
## About me
I am an obsessive thinker with an unrelenting passion for delivering excellence. My commitment to a job well done drives me to approach every task with precision and determination. As someone who thrives on problem-solving, I enjoy diving deep into challenges, unraveling complexities, and ensuring no detail goes unnoticed.

My attentiveness to the finer points enables me to identify gaps others might overlook, a skill that has proven invaluable in testing environments. I believe that true quality lies in the details, and my meticulous nature ensures that the work I deliver meets the highest standards.

Driven by curiosity and a hunger for growth, I constantly seek ways to improve, learn, and adapt. Smart, resourceful, and solutions-oriented, I take pride in my ability to not only meet expectations but exceed them. For me, success isn’t just about completing tasks; it’s about achieving outcomes that stand out.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise in automation testing using Selenium and performance testing with JMeter. My goal is to continuously improve and contribute to quality assurance in software development.

# Skills
#### Manual Testing:
* Test Case Creation: Writing detailed and effective test cases based on acceptance criteria.
* Test Execution: Performing manual testing to verify software functionality, usability, and performance.
* Acceptance Criteria Management: Crafting and modifying acceptance criteria for user stories to ensure clear testing goals.
* Test Scenarios: Designing comprehensive test scenarios to cover various edge cases and user flows.
* Black-Box Testing: Implementing techniques like equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and decision table testing.
* Regression Testing: Ensuring that new changes don’t affect existing functionality.
* Exploratory Testing: Identifying issues without predefined scripts to discover hidden bugs.
* Defect Reporting: Logging clear and actionable bug reports using tools like Jira and Trello.
* Testing Methodologies: Familiarity with Agile, Scrum, sequential, iterative, and incremental models.
* Cross-Device Testing: Checking web and mobile applications for consistency across devices and platforms.
* Collaboration: Working with developers and stakeholders to resolve issues and improve software quality.

#### Api testing:
API testing ensures that the backend services of an application function as expected and communicate correctly with the frontend. Here’s what I know and have practiced in API testing:
* Understanding of API Basics: Familiar with REST APIs, endpoints, and HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
 ##### Postman:
* Using Postman to send requests and validate responses.
* Successfully performed GET and DELETE operations to retrieve and remove data.
* Analyzing response codes, response times, and headers to ensure APIs function as expected.
 * Validation:
* Checking response body content to confirm data accuracy.
* Validating HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
  #### Scenario Testing:
* Creating positive and negative test scenarios to assess API reliability under different conditions.
* Testing edge cases, such as invalid inputs or missing parameters, to identify errors.
#### Performance testing
Performance testing evaluates the speed, scalability, and stability of applications under various conditions. Here’s what I know and have applied in this area:
Understanding Performance Testing:
* Familiar with key performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
Knowledge of testing types like load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing.
#### JMeter:
* Experienced in using Apache JMeter to simulate virtual users and generate load on applications.
* Creating and configuring test plans to assess application performance.
* Executing test scripts to monitor how applications respond under different levels of load.
* Analyzing test results to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
#### Scenario Creation:
* Designing realistic test scenarios that mimic user behavior to evaluate system performance.
* Simulating heavy user traffic to test application stability under peak conditions.
#### Reporting and Collaboration:
* Generating detailed performance reports to share findings with stakeholders.
* Collaborating with developers and system architects to address performance issues.
  #### Automation testing
* Learning to use Selenium WebDriver for automating web application testing.
* Writing basic test scripts in Java to perform actions like login, navigation, and validation.
* Interacting with web elements using techniques like locators (ID, name, CSS selectors, and XPath).
* Understanding the structure of Selenium test scripts, including setup, execution, and teardown.
#### Test Scenario Automation:
*Automating functional tests to ensure application workflows operate correctly.
*Beginning to explore data-driven testing for validating multiple inputs.
# Tools, Platforms and methodologies:
* Familiar with integrating Selenium scripts into tools like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for execution.
* Tools: Selenium, JMeter, Postman, Azure DevOps, Jira, Trello, Zephyr scale
* Languages: Basic knowledge of Java (for Selenium automation)
* Techniques: Black-box Testing, Exploratory Testing, Regression Testing
###### Methodologies:
* Manual Testing: Systematic execution of test cases without automation tools.
* Black-Box Testing: Techniques like equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and exploratory testing.
* Agile Testing: Testing within sprints, adapting to changes, and collaborating with teams.
* Sequential, Iterative, and Incremental Models: Testing at different stages of development.
* Regression Testing: Ensuring updates don’t break existing functionality.
* Performance Testing: Using JMeter to assess system stability and response time.
* API Testing: Validating backend functionality with Postman.
